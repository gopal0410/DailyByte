// Problem: Word Counter
// Date: 11-05-2025
// Author: Gopal Kovachi
// GitHub: gopal0410
// ERP ID: 6605901

// Approach-1: Using built-in function and creating an array of words which were separated by spaces and returning its length
// Approach-2: Counting spaces in the sentences and using if statement for sentences which have multiple spaces between words
// For using split function
// Time Complexity: O(n)
// Space Complexity: O(n)

// For using space count
// Time Complexity: O(n)
// Space Complexity: O(1)
