// Problem: Nth-Fibonacci Term
// Date: 11-08-2025
// Author: Gopal Kovachi
// GitHub: gopal0410
// ERP ID: 6605901

// Approach-1:
// In Approach-1, I just initialized two variables first, and second and set their values as 0 and 1 respectively.
// Then I used for loop and added the elements of first and second and swapped as needed
// Time Complexity: O(n)
// Space Complexity: O(1)
// Approach-2:
// For the second approach, I used recursion and did the same thing as approach 1.
// Two functions were made for this approach. One that calculated the sum recursively till the final nth term is reached and one that calls the recursive function.
// Time Complexity: O(n)
// Space Complexity: O(n)
// Approach:
// I used a mathematical equation known as Binet's Equation to directly find the nth fibonacci term.
// Time Complexity: O(1)
// Space Complexity: O(1)
